        <p class="lessons">Hi, welcome to the first real post 
            of Codingsteps.org! üòÜ
            <br>
            <br>
            I personally think that Python is a good starting programming language for a beginner. Python will allow you to grasp the basics of coding with easy syntaxes, which will let you to learn other programming languages more easily.
            <br>
            <br>            
            I also mainly started to code with Python first, learning about basics of variables, for loops, while loops, and so on. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So I think Python would be a great start for you too! So let‚Äôs get started!
        </p>
        <h2 class="big_size">Preparations Before Coding</h2>
        <p class="lessons">
            Before we dive into writing some lines of code, we need some basic tools that would help us to code.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            We need:
            <br>
                <ol class="listings">
                    <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>IDE</strong></li>
                </ol>
        </p>
            <h3 class="middle_size">Installing Python</h3>
        <p class="lessons">
            First, let‚Äôs go to Pyton‚Äôs main website with the link below.
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Then you would be able to see a page below.
        </p>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/py_lesson_1.jpg" alt="Python lesson 0" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            Then, put your mouse over the Downloads button and you would see another Download button with the version that will install the right version for your computer according to your operating system.
        </p>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/py_lesson_2.jpg" alt="Python lesson 0" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            It automatically finds the right version for you, so just click that Python version button (at the time when I was writing this post, it was 3.9.4). Since I am suing a Windows computer, I am downloading a Windows version.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            After it‚Äôs downloaded, just launch the file and install Python. We won‚Äôt do any custom installations so just install as it is.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            If you want to check whether Python is installed well, open up your command prompt or terminal and just type ‚Äúpython‚Äù
        </p>
        <br>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/py_lesson_3.jpg" alt="Python lesson 0" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            If it is successfully installed you will get something like this. And as you can see, my screen shows version 3.8.3, becasue currently that version is installed on my computer, but if you followed my instructions you would see 3.9.4 probably.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="middle_size">Getting IDE</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            So we got our Python setup, what‚Äôs next?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We need to get our IDE or Integrated Development Environment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Writing python code could be done even with a simple text writer, but with IDE we could make the coding experience much cooler and easier!
            <br>
            <br>
            So, there are a lot of IDEs but I suggest these two:
            <br>
            -Atom IDE
            <br>
            -Visual Studio Code
            <br>
            <br>
            Both of these are really well made and easy to use, but powerful tool for programmers. This is not only bound to Python, but other languages can easily be used. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When I really began to code, I used Atom in the beginning, but later on I started to use VS Code more. The fundamentals are pretty much same, becasue it is all about the actual code itself not so much about the IDE, so it wouldn‚Äôt matter whether you choose <u>Atom</u> or <u>VS Code</u> IDE.
            <br>
            <br>
            To get Atom, go to the link below.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a>
        </p>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/py_lesson_4.jpg" alt="Python lesson 0" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            You would see the download button, and I am pretty sure it would automatically choose the right version for you according to your operating system, for my case, Windows.

            After downloading the file, just go through the normal instalation process.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To get Visual Studio Code, go to the link below.
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>
        </p>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/py_lesson_5.jpg" alt="Python lesson 0" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            You would see the download button also, and again I am  sure it would automatically choose the right version for you according to your operating system. So you could just go ahead and download.
            <br>
            <br>
            After downloading the file, just go through the normal installation process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            And that's all! I think you would be pretty much all set for coding!
