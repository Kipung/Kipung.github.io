        <p class="lessons">Hi, welcome to lesson 2 of Python for Beginners lesson!
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, we are going to learn about variables. <br>
            Variables are very important not only for Python programming language but for any programming language. Since variables will be important, it would be great to build a solid foundation on variables. So, let’s get started!
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="big_size">What are variables?</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            I will assume that most of you are familiar with variables in your math classes, and even if you have never heard about it doesn’t matter too much.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, it is easy to understand variables as a “memory box”. You let the “memory box” to remember what you want it to remember. 
        </p>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/Lesson 2/py_lesson_1.jpg" alt="Python lesson 1" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="lessons">
            For example, if you have a phone number of a very important person, such as your boss, teacher, etc. But obviously you are not going to memorize that, instead you will save the phone number in your phonebook or contact list. Similar to the phonebook, variables in programming will remember what you put in that “memory box”. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="lessons">
            And for our case, we could name our “memory box” with almost anything. It could be called “x”, “y”, or almost anything (usually starts with lower cased letter and has to be connected, so no numbers or uppercased letters). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/Lesson 2/py_lesson_2.jpg" alt="Python lesson 1" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            So, let's see how that works when we code.
        </p>

        <div class="advertisement">
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1615781386315365"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1615781386315365"

</script>

        <span class="beg_picture">
            <img src="/images/Python lesson img/Lesson 2/py_lesson_3.png" alt="Python lesson 1" class="lesson_pic">
        </span>
        <p class="lessons">
            Like in lesson 1, we would make a python file with “.py” at the end of a file name to indicate that we are creating a python file.
            <br>
            <br>
            I will just write it in a code block.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                <p>x = 12</p>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="lessons">
            So, here in the code block, we can see the "x", which is the variable name.
            <br><br>
            As mentioned before, we could name our variables with almost any name, it can be even called "python_is_so_amazing". But as you can notice, I used underscores "_" when I needed a space. <br><br>
             So, when we name a variable, we cannot have a space. If we have a space, python will recognize as something else. So, many people do use underscores for space as a convention. But the important thing is to make a very clear variable names that you could easily understand what that variable means. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The more you deal with variables, you will understand the importance of naming a clear and concise variable name, because when you deal with many variables, you will confuse yourself unless you use very clear names. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    <p>x <strong>=</strong> 12</p>
                </code>
            </pre>
            Now, moving onto the equal sign "=". It means that we are assigning whatever on the right, in this case "12", to the "x" that we named. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Simply, we are telling the computer to remember the number 12 as "x". 
            <br>
            <br>
            You can store texts such as "we are learning Python". However, unlike when we store numbers, for texts or words we have to use quotation makrs. It is up to you whether you use single or double quote. Python treats both the single and double quotes as strings.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    <p>x = "We are learning Python."</p>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <br>
            Until now, what we did was initializing the variables or assigning values to variables. Now we are going to actually call the variables or "use" them.
            <br>
            <br>
            We can call the variables we initialized by putting the variable name we assigned. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One way of calling the variable is through printing out. Previously we only printed out through print(). And inside the parenthesis we manually put the values, but now we are going to put x instead.
            <pre>
                <code>
                   
                    <p>1. x = "We are learning Python."
                        <br>2. print(x)</p>
                </code>
            </pre>
            After we run this code block, we would see the value of x printed out on the console which is "We are learning Python."
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Okay, hopefully that makes sense. And that is it for this lesson!</p>
